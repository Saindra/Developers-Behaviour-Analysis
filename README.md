## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Incase if Anaconda distribution is not installed, then to be able to run these notebooks, the following libraries needs to be installed on the top of python:
1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Matplotlib


## Introduction <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow developer survey 2020 data to better understand the developer's behaviour. I focussed mainly on the following key questions:

1. What are the major Job Factors the developers evaluate while looking for a job?
2. What are programming languages the developers mostly worked/working on now and are interested or desired to work later?
3. Will developers have more Job Satisfaction by having a Master's degree over a Bachelor's degree in some field or by having a CS Major over a Non-CS Major?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repository, there are 3 .ipynb files available to showcase work related to the above questions. I could not put the dataset file in the git repository as it's size is large. But, I provided the dataset link at the bottom of the page here to download. The dataset csv file needs to be in the same folder where the .ipynb files are there.
 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the medium blog post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The major credit goes to Stack Overflow for providing the data. You can find the licensing, data used and its decription [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dfGerWeWkcyQ9GX9x20rdSGj7WtEpzBB/view) to download.
